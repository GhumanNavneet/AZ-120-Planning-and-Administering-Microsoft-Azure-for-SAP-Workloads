   > **Note**: When not using Cloud Shell, the lab virtual machine must have Azure CLI installed [**https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?view=azure-cli-latest**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?view=azure-cli-latest).

Lab files: none

## Scenario
  
In preparation for deployment of SAP NetWeaver on Azure, Adatum Corporation wants to implement a demo that will illustrate highly available implementation of SAP NetWeaver on Azure VMs running the SUSE distribution of Linux.

## Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-   Provision Azure resources necessary to support a highly available SAP NetWeaver deployment

-   Configure operating system of Azure VMs running Linux to support a highly available SAP NetWeaver deployment

-   Configure clustering on Azure VMs running Linux to support a highly available SAP NetWeaver deployment


## Exercise 1: Provision Azure resources necessary to support highly available SAP NetWeaver deployments

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy Azure infrastructure compute components necessary to configure Linux clustering. This will involve creating a pair of Azure VMs running Linux SUSE in the same availability set.

### Task 1: Create a virtual network that will host a highly available SAP NetWeaver deployment.

1.  From the lab computer, start a Web browser, and navigate to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com

1.  If prompted, sign in with the azure credentials provided , you can find them from the environment details tab, which you will be using for this lab and the the Global Administrator role in the Azure AD tenant associated with your subscription.

1.  In the Azure Portal, start a Bash session in Cloud Shell. 

    > **Note**: If this is the first time you are launching Cloud Shell in the current Azure subscription, you will be asked to create an Azure file share to persist Cloud Shell files. If so, accept the defaults, which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically generated resource group.

1.  In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to specify the Azure region that supports availability zones and where you want to create resources for this lab (replace `<region>` with the name of the Azure region as same as your resource group location):

    ```
    LOCATION='<region>'
    ```

1.  In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command (make sure to provide the deployment id , you can find it from the environment details tab):

    ```
    RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME='az12003a-sap-RG-{deployment-id}'
    ```

1.  In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to create a virtual network with a single subnet in the resource group :

    ```
    VNET_NAME='az12003a-sap-vnet'

    VNET_PREFIX='10.3.0.0/16'

    SUBNET_NAME='sapSubnet'

    SUBNET_PREFIX='10.3.0.0/24'

    az network vnet create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location $LOCATION --name $VNET_NAME --address-prefixes $VNET_PREFIX --subnet-name $SUBNET_NAME --subnet-prefixes $SUBNET_PREFIX
    ```

1.  In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to identify the Resource Id of the subnet of the newly created virtual network:

    ```
    az network vnet subnet list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --vnet-name $VNET_NAME --query "[?name == '$SUBNET_NAME'].id" --output tsv
    ```

1.  Copy the resulting value to Clipboard. You will need it in the next task.

### Task 2: Deploy Azure Resource Manager template provisioning Azure VMs running Linux SUSE that will host a highly available SAP NetWeaver deployment

1.  On the lab computer, start a new tab and copy this link and navigate to [**https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/sap-3-tier-marketplace-image-md**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/sap-3-tier-marketplace-image-md)

    > **Note**: Make sure to use Microsoft Edge or a third party browser. Do not use Internet Explorer.

1.  On the page titled **SAP NetWeaver 3-tier compatible template using a Marketplace image - MD**, click **Deploy to Azure**. This will automatically redirect your browser to the Azure portal and display the **SAP NetWeaver 3-tier (managed disk)** blade.

1.  On the **SAP NetWeaver 3-tier (managed disk)** blade, click **Edit template**

1.  On the **Edit template** blade, locate the variable named **images**, locate the **SLES 12** section within the variable definition, and verify that the value of the `sku` key is `12-SP4`:

    ```
    "sku": "12-SP4", 
    ```

1.  Click **Save**. 

1.  Back on the **SAP NetWeaver 3-tier (managed disk)** blade, initiate deployment with the following settings:

    -   Subscription: *the name of your Azure subscription*

    -   Resource group: **az12003a-sap-RG-{deployment-id}**

    -   Location: *the same Azure region that you specified in the first task of this exercise*

    -   SAP System Id: **I20**

    -   Stack Type: **ABAP**

    -   Location: **[resourceGroup().location]**

    -   _artifacts Location: **https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/sap-3-tier-marketplace-image-md/**

    -   _artifacts Location Sas Token: *leave blank*

1.  Do not Wait for the deployment to complete but instead proceed to the next task. 

1. If the deployment fails, review the deployment details and identify the VM(s)(in this case it will be i20-db-0 and i20-db-1) where the installation of the CustomScriptExtension failed, then peform the below steps:
   - Navigate to the blade of the VM(s) you identified, then select Extensions. From the Extensions blade, click on **Custom Script** entry, then click on **Uninstall** to uninstall the CustomScript extension.
   - From the Azure portal, navigate to the az12003a-sap-RG-{deployment-id} resource group blade, then  select Deployments, select the link to the failed deployment, and select Redeploy. 
   - To redeploy, you will need to select the target resource group (az12003a-sap-RG-{deployment-id}) and provide the password for the root account (Pa55w.rd1234).Ignore the error coming under resource group


### Task 3: Deploy a jump host

    ```
    primitive rsc_st_azure_1 stonith:fence_azure_arm \
         params subscriptionId="subscription_id" resourceGroup="az12003a-sap-RG" tenantId="tenant_id" login="login_id" passwd="password"
    primitive rsc_st_azure_2 stonith:fence_azure_arm \
         params subscriptionId="subscription_id" resourceGroup="az12003a-sap-RG" tenantId="tenant_id" login="login_id" passwd="password"
    colocation col_st_azure -2000: rsc_st_azure_1:Started rsc_st_azure_2:Started
    ```

1.  From the SSH session on i20-db-0, apply the settings in the file by running **crm configure load update crm-fencing.txt**:
    ```
    crm configure load update crm-fencing.txt
    ```

### Task 8: Review clustering configuration on Azure VMs running Linux by using Hawk

1.  Within the RDP session to az12003a-vm0, start Internet Explorer and navigate to **https://i20-db-0:7630**. This should display the SUSE Hawk sign-in page.

   > **Note**: Ignore **This site is not secure** message.

1.  On the SUSE Hawk sign in page, login by using the following credentials:

    -   Username: **hacluster**

    -   Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

1.  Verify that the cluster status is healthy. If you are seeing a message indicating that one of two cluster nodes is unclean, restart that node from the Azure portal.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have configured clustering on Azure VMs running Linux to support a highly available SAP NetWeaver deployment


## Exercise 4: Remove lab resources

Duration: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will remove resources provisioned in this lab.

#### Task 1: Open Cloud Shell

1. At the top of the portal, click the **Cloud Shell** icon to open Cloud Shell pane and choose Bash as the shell.

1. At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt at the bottom of the portal, type in the following command and press **Enter** to list all resource groups you created in this lab:

    ```
    az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az12003a-')]".name --output tsv
    ```

1. Verify that the output contains only the resource groups you created in this lab. These groups will be deleted in the next task.

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1. At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt, type in the following command and press **Enter** to delete the resource groups you created in this lab

    ```
    az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az12003a-')]".name --output tsv | xargs -L1 bash -c 'az group delete --name $0 --no-wait --yes'
    ```

1. Close the **Cloud Shell** prompt at the bottom of the portal.


> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have removed the resources used in this lab.
